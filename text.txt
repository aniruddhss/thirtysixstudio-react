this is how we animate here, the first 150 images are loaded and they are like frames of a single 3d element 
const [index, setIndex] = useState({value:0});

    const canvasRef = useRef(null);

    useGSAP(()=>{
        gsap.to(index,{
            value:149,
            duration:3,
            repeat:-1,
            ease:"linear",
            onUpdate:()=>{
                setIndex({value:Math.round(index.value)})
            },
        });
    });

    this function allows us to load the first 150 images one after the other to create a animation effefct
